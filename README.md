## DESIGN
Our design practice offers a full range of services including brand strategy, interaction and visual design and user experience testing.

Throughout the project, our designers create and implement visual design and workflows, solicit user feedback and work with you to make sure what gets built is what is needed.

This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve.

We collaborate with the team to write, and improve code on a daily basis, using proven practices such as test-driven development and pair programming.
